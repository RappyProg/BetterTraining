Day 4 - Purwadhika
Array and Function

how to make array
- arr = []
- arr = new Array()

methods:
- push --> add value at the back
- pop --> remove value from the back
seems that it uses last in first out (LIFO) mechanic
- shift --> remove value from front
- unshift --> add value from front
- splice --> can be used to remove and add something. but mostly remove. 
If using splice (x, 0, y, z) you will add y and z after the index x. 
Splice(x) to remove everything from index x onwards.
- sort((a,b) => a-b) ascending, b-a descending. // the => is basically ternary function
just sort() will sort it lexicographically like 101, 2, 304, 4000, so just be careful, but this is nice to know
- reverse --> reverse the index, back to front
- forEach & map --> for looping. The difference is that map can produce new array.
- reduce --> for arithmetic operation so it's like x.reduce((a,b) => a +-*/**% b) 

function --> packaging rules, or any sort of coding
can be done in 2 ways
- function(...){}
- x = function(...){}

function scope --> variable that is made inside a function can only be used by that function, even var.
function sum(a, b)
a and b are called parameters
if you put a = 0 --> this became default parameter

function sum(a,b,...more)
...more is a rest paremeter so it can catch whatever stray arguments your wife puts in
then you can put console.log(...more) to show it on output.
